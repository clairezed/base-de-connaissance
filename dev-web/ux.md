San Francisco 6:25pm

Each day designers gather for after-hour meetups in several modern-looking buildings across San Francisco in the SoMa, Financial District, and Market Street neighborhoods. Meetups in the Bay Area tend to happen after hours, either in coworking spaces or at the corporate offices of tech companies. Attendees can expect the usual: turnstyle, badge, refreshments, networking, talks, and more networking.

   e’ve spent the last few years living and working in Silicon Valley and have had a chance to join a considerable number of design and tech meetups across the Bay Area — where these industries are particularly active. A simple search on meetup.com will return at least 20 different events to choose from each week. Topics, ranging from Artificial Intelligence to Augmented Reality are peppered with the same buzzwords you can see on the homepage of FastCompany or The Verge on any given day.



Often our meetup experiences were less than inspiring. With overly ambitious topics and fear-inducing titles, these gatherings proved to be little more than a series of startup pitches camouflaged as thought leadership topics.













The more fruitful discussions, usually scheduled for the end of the evening, often never happened. Companies would get so caught up in talking about themselves that they would run out of time, every time. This means walking away with no profound discussion and no engaged Q&A.



On the way home from one of these lackluster events we took a deeper look at the situation, wondering why these events were so unfulfilling. We felt like we had been duped, once again, into believing that these talks were going to dive deeper into the proposed topics instead of focusing on selling their company’s services.


Turns out the problem was not the meetups themselves.











The places where designers “meet” online are not any different. If you have been following design communities online you might have noticed how often content marketing is disguised as community content, quite similar to the bait-and-switch real-world meetups we have attended. These companies often use fear-inducing clickbait headlines and hidden agendas to try to sell products, services, or ideas.









—

While designers tend to be skeptical of magic formulas—we’re decidedly suspicious of self-help gurus, magic diets, or miraculous career advice—we have a surprisingly high tolerance for formulaic solutions when it comes to design. We can’t resist a list of “The 5 UX Mistakes You Are Probably Making Right Now”, or “The 5 Sketch Plugins to Get the Promotion You Deserve”. We fall for it every time.


Our impostor syndrome kicks in. And we click.



There’s a reason companies have been investing in content marketing so aggressively over the past few years. They want clicks, they want to build relevance in search results, and they want to be positioned as thought leaders in topics such as UX, prototyping, and design.











The result is an increasing number of articles heavy with buzzwords, links to free e-books, and click-bait headlines that help companies pull traffic to their sites.



But if you look closely, you’ll see the same approach being used not only by companies but by designers as well. We often repeat that very same formula to attract attention and clicks to our portfolios, to our articles, and to our personal brand.


We can’t help but ask ourselves—

Are we designers Shamelessly good at self-promotion?

Art Direction: Frederico Felix

In February 2018, in an article for FastCoDesign, Khoi Vinh, Design Principal at Adobe, highlighted the arrested state of the design discourse.







“...left to our own devices as the chroniclers of our own profession, designers tend not to examine their own work with particularly rigorous scrutiny.”





The problem, according to Khoi, is that most of what’s published in our industry is written by designers themselves. Designers who have too much skin in the game. Designers who find it hard to honestly critique another designer’s or another company’s work, because there’s a possibility they could end up working together in the future. Designers who are so involved in the tactical execution of day-to-day tasks that they find it hard to step back and focus on the impact of design beyond design—how it contributes to the greater good of society.



In a nutshell, there are four key principles the design discourse is missing:

Independence

DEPTH

HONESTY

Breadth

Writers who will not profit in any way from the content that they are producing.

Long-form content that goes beyond the surface and investigates multiple sides of an issue.















Thoughtful criticism that won’t hurt relationships because is focused on the design, not the designer.

















Content that provokes designers to reflect on the broader impact of design not only in our community, but for society at large.

















H

  istorically, our ability to talk about our own work (a.k.a. “self-promotion”) comes from a place of survival. For a long time, designers have been the minority in their companies. We've had to fight hard for attention at all levels, constantly explaining what Design does and how it can help other internal teams. We've had to set budgets that would allow design teams to grow and improve our practice, and claim a “seat at the table” by honing our ability to participate in strategic conversations within the organization.


And we’ve gotten really good at it.



On the other hand, there are great designers out there who are simply not passionate about writing or talking publicly about design, but are amazingly talented thinkers and makers. The ability to talk about design should not define how talented a designer is—but in a world where personal branding has become so crucial to driving job opportunities, salary increases, and promotions, a lot of times designers see themselves having to talk about their own accomplishments more often than they would like to.

—

We read Khoi’s article over and over and over.



And decided to research more closely the why, what, and how behind the content that designers share online.

We analyzed every single link for an entire month.

We started broad. For a month, we looked at the most popular online forums (like DesignerNews, WebDesignerNews, StackExchange UX, and Reddit UserExperience) and newsletters (like Sidebar, Product Weekly, UX Curator, and our very own UX Collective), and made a comprehensive list of links that were shared by both the community and the curators.


We then narrowed it down to the most active and renowned design communities out there. Every link shared between 2/12 and 3/11 was put under the microscope, through the lenses of independence, honesty, breadth, and depth.









Our first step was to look at content types. How tactical is the content we are sharing? On a spectrum that goes from executional to reflective, how much are we pushing our thinking as an industry — as opposed to simply sharing tutorials designed to be followed step by step?





Since measuring how executional or reflective a piece of content is can be a bit subjective (“wait, is a UI Kit more or less tactical than a persona template?”), for the sake of this study we created a broad scale and attributed a certain score to each type of link. Articles providing no-brainer tools and templates to download, for example, are all in the same tactical content group.


A case study, on the other hand, sits somewhere in the middle of that spectrum. As you are reading through a case study you are learning about that company’s process, design approach, toolkit, and thinking. You are also likely taking the opportunity to reflect on your own process, and what can be improved. Case studies strike a good balance between offering tangible learnings and encouraging broader reflection and discussions by the community.


Towards the other end of the spectrum we included more strategic and insightful pieces: design critiques, reflections on our profession, thoughts on ethics, and questions about design’s larger impact on society and culture.













So… what type of content do we share online?
[Privacy Badger has replaced this Twitter button.]

An entire month worth of design links, categorized from tactical to strategic

As you can imagine, the links were considerably heavier on the tactical side of the spectrum.


This makes sense as tactical links are important to our industry. Knowing the latest software tricks, having UI Kits handy, or installing extensions that will optimize your workflow certainly creates efficiencies in your process and better work overall.


The whole concept of how “tactical” or “shallow” a link is can be quite subjective. Sacha Greif, founder and curator of Sidebar.io, analyzes the matter in a really interesting way: “One person's cliché-filled article on the golden ratio is another's eye-opening essay on the wonders of nature, so I try to remember that ‘good writing’ is subjective.”



On the other hand, the reduced amount of content on the more strategic side of the spectrum may be a sign that our industry is neglecting deeper reflections on our practice and on our impact beyond our own community.

Who is behind
the links?



77%

Self-promoters

The person who posts the link has personal or professional connection with its creator – they have either written the post themselves or work at the company that has created it. Honestly, we’re guilty of this one, too.



“Look at this amazing article!” says the person who actually wrote the article.

“Look at this amazing article!” says the person who actually wrote the article.

47%

Skin in the game



Either the person or the company they work for offers professional services related to the topic. They offer consultancy, they want to be positioned as thought leaders in that vertical, or somethow their business benefits from how much traction that story gets.





“How to build chatbots the right way”, says the company who offers bot development services.



21%

Shameless

Almost one in each five links turns out to be the first step of a conversion funnel. The destination website contains an explicit call-to-action to buy a book, pay for a course, or purchase tickets for an event. In some cases the transaction is not monetary, but involves lead generation.

“Enter your email to download our free e-book”, says the company who will spam you for the rest of your days.























—

We then looked at the potential motivation for people to share those links. In the majority of cases there is a pretty clear connection between the person who posts the link and the entity behind its creation, whether a company or an individual.























Although online forum websites (like DesignerNews) are created to be a space for discussion and conversation, the reality is that in recent years they are primarily used for one-way promotion.






[Privacy Badger has replaced this Twitter button.]

During a recent exchange between members of DesignerNews, a user calls out that the website took a turn when registration shifted from invite-only to open to the general public. Add to it lack of moderation (something DN is actively trying to fix now) and what you see is a homepage filled with links that are clearly trying to promote tools, services, and personal branding. “I'm wondering what happened to the real constructive design community that used to create valuable content in here”, writes one of the members.


While this type of behavior has been observed in similar open platforms, there is something about the tactical nature of the links that got us thinking this might be the symptom of a more profound issue.

How deep is the content we share?





We are quite busy.


We have a handful of designs to deliver by the end of the day.


Our Product Manager is giving not-so-subtle looks from behind our screen to see if we’re actually getting work done.


A new survey republished by FastCo suggests creative professionals are being asked to do more work in less time—and it’s taking a toll. We don’t have time during the day to stop what we’re doing and read long articles or watch lengthy talks that dive into a certain topic. So shorter stories suit us well.


Even if our industry had independent writers solely dedicated to creating in-depth, thought-provoking design content, would we actually have enough hours in the day to consume it?



We decided to look back at the links we collected. Of all links shared between 02/12 and 03/11, more than 60% took users to a Medium article.

Yep, you read it right. More than 60% of the links we share are Medium articles.









Medium gives you the average reading time of each article. If you’re not familiar with writing and publishing content on their platform, they’ve figured out that the reading time of an article greatly influences its success, or failure—so much so that capturing reading time has become a science in itself.



Medium’s clap-focused algorithm prioritizes stories that are short and easy to read. This has motivated authors to condense their stories, or break them down into smaller chunks, in an attempt to meet the ever-shrinking attention span of the average reader.

































Average reading time of Medium articles shared by designers on online forums between 02/12 and 03/11

Back in 2013, when Medium was just a small, promising content platform that was starting to get traction, the optimal reading time was about 7 minutes. A few years later, the average design article is now 5 minutes or less.










So, our next question was:


How much time do we actually have to browse and read content about design on the internet?



For designers, how long is too long?

Meet Alfie, Bruna, Charlie, Dennis,
and Elena.

   e invited five designers from different industries (agencies, small business, big tech company, and enterprise) and a variety of locations (from Sao Paulo to Tokyo) to help us understand how they remain current with the ever changing world of design.










Using a diary study approach, we messaged Alfie, Bruna, Charlie, Dennis, and Elena (not their real names) every day for a week asking how, when and why they consumed design content each day.

Diary Study?

User logs (diaries) of daily activities as they occur give contextual insights about real-time user behaviors and needs, helping define UX feature requirements. — source















It was surprising to see the similarity across the designers’ attitudes, motivations, and behaviors.


Starting with their routine.

My goal is to have as few typical weeks as possible.

A DAY IN THE LIFE OF A DESIGNER

(As it relates to design-related content consumption)

MORNING HITS

As soon as they wake up, each designer is instantly connected. While sipping coffee they take a quick scroll through newsletters and social media feeds to check headlines, news, and get a quick hit of inspiration before they start the day. Podcasts and videos are the perfect company for long commutes.



Slackers

Colleagues often share links on Slack about design tools, tips, methods, and other content related to their business. They are usually read in breaks between tasks throughout the day.



Pro-active research

While working on a project, they all rely on active research to refresh their knowledge about a particular method or tool they plan to use in that project. This is on-demand, focused research, to counterbalance the more passive content consumption they experience on a daily basis.



Fear of missing out (and drown-ing in)

As their day goes by, the designers check Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter multiple times. They all follow design-related accounts in each of those networks. Scrolling gives them a gist of what’s trending, but attempting to dive into every little headline can make them feel as if they are missing out.


That's where newsletters come in. These shorter form media outlets offer a more curated list of links and news—zoning in on the question: “what are the most essential links I need to be aware of today?”













“

I don't use RSS feeds anymore. It made me anxious. Someone will filter the content for me. If not someone, an algorithm like Google Now.

Save for 'later'

When the headline is enough



Often times the headline is enough to give the designers a sense of the content within, so the article itself can be ignored. If the article or video is rather short, they quickly check it out, though the ideas it is sharing won’t be deeply assimilated.

Longer pieces for later



An exciting article will often end up being saved to be read later. They want to read it, but they don't have the time or focus required during the day.


"Later" often never happens.

“

So today, I got to work and checked my email, and inevitably ended up opening multiple tabs of articles to read later.

“

Some of the articles end up being read, others stay in my tabs all week and eventually I close them and decide to let go of them without reading.

Search to the rescue



Overwhelmed by the number of saved articles, all participants relied on Google to go back to an article they saw a while ago or to find new content on a topic they were researching. It's almost like they outsource their memory to Google.



In that context, SEO and content marketing play a key role for companies. Showing up as the first result when designers search for the "best prototyping tool" can help them generate an enormous amount of leads.

“

When trying to retrieve an article I have read in the past, I often do an extremely focused search on Google, using the author's name and keywords from the topic.

“

SEO has improved a lot lately. So when I need to find something specific, I just google the keywords. I also use Google Scholar as well.



Content as the ultimate design tool





Searches during the day are always related to something designers are working on. The links shared on the company's Slack channels usually fit this more pragmatic approach to content, and they are often the ones that are read and discussed among the colleagues.


Designers don't need to memorize all the specifics about how to operate a tool (including its many shortcuts and workflow tips). They can quickly Google it, watch a 5-minute tutorial on the topic, and instantly become an expert.

“

I would Google some of the keywords I had in mind to see if something new pops up. I found a paper that looked promising, but it was too technical. So I didn’t read it.

“

I'm preparing a lecture so I Googled about the topic to refresh and review the content that I had on my slides.

How trustworthy is the content they find?







After understanding more about their routine and how they find content, we asked the designers how they perceived the content they saw and how satisfied they were with it.


Not surprisingly, they think there are too many clickbait articles. They regard them the same as other clickbait-y news items that are not design-related: they sometimes give a cautious click while counting the precious seconds of their attention that are going to the publisher. And they often leave without receiving any meaningful information, ideas, or inspiration.


Nevertheless, they find that there is outstanding content out there to be consumed. To find it, the designers have a circle of trust comprised of a few sources and authors whom they trust and respect and as well as colleagues who share content and experiences with them.


When they are yearning for answers to a more profound or broader question, they take an IRL approach, talking with other designer friends. In this way they receive honest perspectives on circumstances that curated articles often miss.

Everything is polished… No one talks about mistakes
[Privacy Badger has replaced this Twitter button.]

—Alfie, innovation designer within a healthcare organization in San Francisco

Content is becoming increasingly polished and content creators are spending much more time crafting the stories before they put them out in the world. Companies are also creating polished content since they too want to be seen as thought leaders and have their products associated with the concept of good design.


However, a polished piece doesn't necessarily mean more profound, insightful, or trustworthy content.


In the words of one of the research participants: "Most of the work I see online looks overly finished and polished, almost like portfolio pieces. It is harder to find procedural, transparent and honest design content."



This is not much different from what we are experiencing outside of the design world. Just as we are living curated lives on our social networks and fabricating perfect versions ourselves, many are also doing this with our work. The same designers that are cynical about Instagram celebrities often fall for it when it's related to their jobs.



But wait… where does the really good content come from?





To understand the motivations behind content creation, we decided to talk to experts in that area. We reached out to authors we really admire, who have been sharing and publishing high-quality content online for years, sometimes decades.


Why are they dedicating time to sharing their experiences online?
