# Breaking the time barrier

*-> Notes prises à la lecture du court bouquin [Breaking the time barrier](https://www.freshbooks.com/assets/other/Breaking-the-Time-Barrier.pdf)*


I want to know the pain they might be experiencing, the problems they want to solve. [...]
Both of us should know that the price they are going to pay makes sense based on the value they can expect from my services.
So I’ll keep nudging that conversation forward until we get some clarity. In an ideal world, the client can express what they’re trying to achieve in a dollar figure, like revenue. Or cost saving.

-> ‘How much is a client worth to you?’
-> ‘What does success look like to you? How are you going to know you’ve achieved what you want?’
-> Pourquoi voulez-vous faire évoluer votre site ?


## The seven mutual benefits of exploring value with your clients

1. creates trust

Comme un docteur, s'intéresser et poser les questions qui montrent que vous êtes un professionnel, que vous comprenez leur problème.

2. Fosters alignment

S'accorder sur deux choses :
- A. où le client en est maintenant
- B. où le client veut aller -> questions sur les objectifs du client.

Valeur = réduire le gap entre A et B

3. Helps your client better evaluate vendors

4. Frames the solution as an investment, not an expense

Parler d'investissement plutôt que de prix

5. Inspires action

When I help my clients paint the picture of what Point B looks like, they’re eager to
make those results come true.

6.  Lets your client make an informed business decision

If a client wants to pay less, they have to choose to have less delivered.

7. Establishes a trusted partnership


## Exemple

- option 1 that included various outputs and phases, things like customer research, a website audit, a market analysis, a complete redesign, various tests, and so on. Each element had distinct value.

- “My other two options included extras like daily reports to help the client make timely business decisions. Something like that might be worth tens of thousands to the client, so I set the price based on that. By the way, the client chose the top package for $125,000.”

The price of option one them added together was $100,000, which was 10% of the total value the client could expect. By the way, the fee I charge will often range from 10% to 20% of the expected value, and usually the difference has to do with the risks involve
