Focusing Talks: Three Questions
14 f√©vrier 2013, 16:31

I always ask three questions when I begin to prepare a talk. More important than the three actual questions, though, is why I ask them. That's what why I will start with the motivation before introducing the questions.



My biggest challenge when putting together a talk is that I want to cover too much material. How often do I say, "The speaker tried to cover too much"? How often do I say, "That wasn't enough material for a talk"? 10:1? 50:1? And with the growth of short forms like Pecha Kucha, the challenge of scoping a talk becomes more acute.



Sometimes I think that my tendency to talk about too much comes from excitement--I love what I am doing so much that I want to explain it all. To be honest, though, I think when I super-size a talk it's because I am desperate for approval. If I explain absolutely everything, I think insanely, everyone is sure to be impressed by something.



Whatever my real motivation, my impulse to cram too much material into a talk is a disaster. A cluttered, rushed talk conveys neither information nor excitement. There is no time for story-telling or repetition, two techniques that I use to memorably emphasize points. My cure for bloated talks is focus, focus, focus. How? That's what the three questions are for:



1) Who is the audience? The more specific the answer, the better. "Steve Vinoski," for example is an excellent audience. "Programmers" is too broad. "Programmers and their managers" might just as well be "everybody". I want a defined audience that will help me discard material. "Steve already knows that," "Steve won't be interested in this wrinkle," "Steve might disagree with this, so I need to set it up."



My dilemma is that I want broad impact. If I pick a narrow audience, aren't I throwing away the chance to speak to more people? The sad truth is that many talks don't affect anyone's life at all. Better to reach one person than zero. Once I am able to reach one person, others in the actual audience sitting there are likely to be able to "get it" too. Even people who don't get it right there may be interested in following up later. Impact starts with one.



Okay, I've picked my one person and bid a sad farewell to the regard of the rest of the audience. Now I have to decide what to talk about.



2) What is my one startling sentence? I need a point that is going to make Steve (sorry to be picking on you, man) sit up and take notice, a point that will make him stop checking his email, a point that will send his eyebrows into his hairline, a point, if I really do my job right, that will make the hair on the back of his neck stand up. "Moving from Erlang to Go reduced capex 80%"--that would do it (if I can back it up). "Implementing a distributed system in Go"--not.



It needs to be startling because otherwise I won't have Steve's attention. It needs to be a sentence because I want it to be memorable and hard to ignore. And there needs to be one sentence because otherwise the audience will be confused about what to pay attention to. (--not sure what I mean by this but it seems right so i'll leave it here--)



What if I reduced capex 80% and increased up-time by a full 9? They are both achievements. They are both worth talking about. Steve might even be interested in both. Tough. My goal in answering these questions is getting to a manageable scope. Capex or up-time, not both. Which would Steve be most interested in?



Picking one sentence, I encourage focus and empathy in myself. Now I have one person's attention. What do I say?



3) What would I like the audience to do? Do I hope that they write their first program in a new language? Start a real project in the language? Do academic research on the language? Change how they think about their language?



Early in my career I asked this question in a manipulative way--how can I trick them into doing what I want? Even though I am (mostly) over that way of thinking, I find the question still helpful as a focuser. For that one person in the audience, attentive because of the one startling sentence, I still have way too much to talk about if I include everything I can think of around that sentence for that person. "To what purpose?" helps me discard interesting-but-tangential points, to, as Peter Jackson put it, move the ring.



Once I have answered the three questions, I still have a long way to go before I have a talk. I have to find stories, illustrations, examples, find an arc, engage emotions, connect to knowns, find a voice, choreograph, and (ugh!) draw slides. The weaker my answers to the questions, the more I try to make up for it with speaking tricks, and the less love I can convey and the less impact I have. The more clear and uncompromising I can be with the three questions, though, the easier all the rest of it becomes. The more of my own discomfort I can confront while answering, the closer to the heart I can speak.



So that's what I do. Talk about less. And less. Less than that. The day someone tells me, "That really wasn't worth an hour," then I can back off a little.



My decisions about what not to talk about are guided by the desire that what I say will actually matter to someone. My experience is that the more my talks matter to someone, the more someones they end up touching.
